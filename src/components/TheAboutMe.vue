      <p class="text-white">
        I've been programming since I was 12. I am 17 now.
        <br/> <br/>
        I learnt really by just doing. The first thing I started doing was Discord bots with Discord.JS. They were really basic and just basically made some cool commands, like 8-ball guessing the future... really simple.
        Now I am in a Finnish public high school, a second-year student (out of three years). So school eats a lot of my free time too and I don't have that much time to develop stuff.
        <br/> <br/>
        However, I have started more deeply trying new stuff whenever I have the time for it. For example, during the last year I learnt graphics programming in C++ with OpenGL (I did try Vulkan, but it was way too complicated for my graphics understanding level). This website is also an example of me just trying new stuff.
        <br/> <br/>
        I plan to major in Computer Science after finishing high school and serving in the mandatory time in the Finnish Defence Forces.

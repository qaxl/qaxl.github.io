I am 17 now. <br> <br> I learnt really by just doing. The first thing I started doing was Discord bots with Discord.JS. They were really basic and just basically made some cool commands, like 8-ball guessing the future... really simple. Now I am in a Finnish public high school, a second-year student (out of three years). So school eats a lot of my free time too and I don&#39;t have that much time to develop stuff. <br> <br> However, I have started more deeply trying new stuff whenever I have the time for it. For example, during the last year I learnt graphics programming in C++ with OpenGL (I did try Vulkan, but it was way too complicated for my graphics understanding level). This website is also an example of me just trying new stuff. <br> <br> I plan to major in Computer Science after finishing high school and serving in the mandatory time in the Finnish Defence Forces. </p></section><section class="bg-gray-500 p-10"><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Skills</h2><p class="text-gray-800"> Programming languages: <ul><li>C: I have experimented with the language, and used it for low-level experiments.</li><li>Rust: I like, but haven&#39;t really gotten use for it.</li><li>C++: dozen of libraries and frameworks, have used extensively since 2020.</li><li>JS (and TS): First languages I&#39;ve used since starting programming.</li></ul><br> Languages: <ul><li>English</li><li>Finnish</li></ul></p></section><section class="bg-red-500 p-10 text-right"><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Portfolio/projects</h2><a class="text-blue-600" href="/projects">View my accomplishments here.</a></section><section class="bg-purple-500 p-10 text-right"><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Contact</h2><p class="text-white">I will eventually add proper contact information, for now, though, you will have to either contact me thru GitHub or Discord via the buttons on the right corner of the header.</p></section>',5),h=[c];function m(s,o){return e(),t("div",r,h)}const d=i(l,[["render",m]]),p={__name:"AboutView",setup(s){return(o,u)=>(e(),t("main",null,[n(d)]))}};export{p as default};
